  <p class="project-section-head">What is Headspace?</p>
  <p class="project-section-text"><a href="https://www.headspace.com/" class="in-text-link">Headspace</a> is a health and wellness app designed to assist users and their mental health journey through guided meditation and calming soundscapes.</p>

    <p class="project-section-head">User Research</p>
    <p class="project-section-text">In order to identify areas that could be expanded and supplemented on the Headspace app, I conducted user interviews and user testing. Based their target audience who are users wanting to dabbleg in meditation and focus on mindfulness, I found 2 potential users of the app, one that was a beginner to mental health and wellness apps and another that had used health and wellness apps in the past, I instructed them to explore the app on their own and asked them questions while they were using the app to get their immediate thoughts, similar to think-aloud testing. </p>
    <p class= "project-section-text">I asked targeted questions to understand their likes, dislikes and how they would realistically use Headspace day to day, in additon to  observing how they navigated through the app.</p>

      <p class = "img-caption">Notes from user-tests.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="project-section-text">Based on the results of my user research I determined that users wanted more <b>personalization</b> and <b>options for progress tracking</b> on Headspace. To fit the mission and purpose of Headspace to promote self-care and reflection, I wanted to come up with solutions that allowed users to cater thier user experience to their specific mental health journeys and allow them to reflect on their progress</p>

          <p class= "highlight-text">Activity Tracking</p>

          <p class="project-section-text">Daily Check-Ins would be accessible from the user's personal account/profile page. To encourage users to log their progress and feelings with Headspace daily and for users to easily see an overview of their recordings the feature is displayed in a calendar.</p>

          <p class= "project-section-subhead">New Daily Check-In Entry</p>
          <p class="project-section-text">Based off conducted user interviews and research, a critique of the Headspace app was that Headspace doesn’t offer useful progress tracking options. A daily check-in feature would allow users to log their progress in more detail and they would be able log their progress whenever they want, to log their moods, activities and notes as they progress on their mental health journey and help them to better understand themselves or their habits.</p>

          <p class="project-section-text">Users are able to edit past logs if there is something they forgot or they want to add something, making the feature user-friendly and easy for them to go back and change their entries.</p>

          <p class="project-section-text">Additonally, as a way for users to reflect on their past logs they can easily see an overview of specific days and what they logged that day.</p>

  <section class= "project-section">
      <p class="project-section-head">Reflection</p>
      <p class="project-section-text">This project allowed me to increase my skills in prototyping. In doing so, I had to learn how to use a new software “Protopie” to build my prototype, which proved to be difficult for me. To combat this setback, I gave myself a lot of time to work out any issues in my prototype and research tutorials on how to use Protopie. Additionally, this project helped me to exercise my ability to adapt new elements to a pre-existing visual brand, and I received feedback from my teaching team applauding the seamlessness of the final design prototype.</p>
      <p class="project-section-text">If I were to revisit this project I would definitely want to expand more on building a personalized experience for Headspace, as many users vouched for having personalized meditating and mental health help. In doing that and to add more value to Headspace with my additonal feature I would like to add pages that catered toward the daily entries users would log, that reccommended Headspace meditations or podcasts based on information the user had recently logged.</p>
