      <ul class="project-section-text">
        <li>Memory loss and forgetfulness that comes with aging makes it difficult for users to remember things such as appointments, medications, or daily tasks.</li>
        <li>As users age they want to regain their independence and feel like they can take care of themselves.</li>
        <li>Elderly users want to feel that they are in control and can keep up with their health and maintain healthy lifestyles by themselves.</li>

        </div>
      </div>

    <section class= "project-section">
      <p class="project-section-text">Seeing as we were designing for elderly users and a problem space we were unfamiliar with, it was necessary we understood users' needs when using technology to understand what would make the UI the most accessible for them with deterioriating vision, hearing and mobility that typically comes with age. Thus, we conducted additional research on useful design practices and features we could implement to assist our users.</p>
      <p class="project-section-subhead">Key Findings</p>
      <ul class="project-section-text">
        <li>Severe vision loss is usually caused by age-related cataracts, macular degeneration or diabetes. The main issues reported are reduced contrast sensitivity, reduced color perception, and weaker near-focus. (<a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2016/0801/p219.html" class="in-text-link">source</a>)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/icon-usability-and-design" class="in-text-link">Icons</a> should be labelled and not used independently to convey information</li>
        <li>To supplement memory loss: on’t divide screens into multiple actions — one focus at once will have better results, give clear feedback on progress and completion and use simple plain backgrounds to avoid distraction. (<a href="https://uxplanet.org/accessible-design-designing-for-the-elderly-41704a375b5d" class="in-text-link">source</a>)</li>
        <li>San-serif typefaces are easier to read on-screen.</li>
        <li>Use a high-contrast colour palette.</li>

        <p class="project-section-head">Design Process</p>
        <p class="project-section-text">Our intervention was created through an iterative process, in which every week we would present our progress to our teaching team to recieve feedback.</p>
        <p class= "project-section-text"> Based on our initial research the team wanted to create an app with the following features: an onboarding screen that allows users to customize their user experience, a daily log for users to input their daily health symptoms and activities, a calendar and reminders to help users remember upcoming events and daily tasks.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="project-section-text">It was essential to curate a colour palette and typeface that was highly visible for our users that need a higher contrast palette and simple characters for readability. From our sketches we created high fidelity wireframes and applied our art direction.</p>

        </div> -->

        <p class="project-section-subhead">Colour Palette Iterations</p>

        <p class= "project-section-text">When presenting this iteration to our teaching team we recieved feedback that the colour palette was still <b>not high contrast enough</b> which prompted us to go back to developing and testing a suitable colour palette. The team went back to the drawing board and tested new colour palettes based on what was recommended in our secondary research before coming to a dark purple and pink.</p>

          <p class="project-section-subhead">Prototype Development</p>
          <p class="project-section-text">With our finalized wireframes we were able to move them to the prototyping stage. Using the prototyping software 'Protopie' I prototyped a majority of the application to use for our final user testing.</p>

        <section class= "project-section">
          <p class="project-section-head">User-Testing</p>
          <p class="project-section-text">We conducted user-testing with users within our desired age range (75+) and received feedback before applying necessary changes. We shared a pre-test questionnaire to gather users' experiences with health/reminder related apps as well as a post-test questionnaire to define areas with usability issues.</p>
          <p class= "project-section-text"> I conducted a user-testing session with one of our recruited users using Think-Aloud testing methods with a given list of tasks to complete to simulate how a user would typically use AgeWell (ex. create a new account and login, create a reminder, complete a daily check-in), and took notes as they shared their thought process throughout the testing session and prompted them afterwards to share any difficulties they faced during the test.</p>

                    </div>

          <p class= "project-section-text">Each team member interviewed and conducted testing sessions with one potential user. To organize and narrow down key issues users faced we created an affinity diagram and sorted each observation and comment we noted down by common underlying issues. From this diagram we were able to identify three issues that were brought up in every test.</p>

The app allows seniors to keep track of their medications, daily symptoms, appointments with doctors, and other day to day tasks or events they need to remember. AgeWell is perfect for seniors who are struggling with old-age-related memory loss and want to regain independence and control in their lives.</p>

  <section class= "project-section">
      <p class="project-section-head">Reflection</p>
      <p class="project-section-text">Developing AgeWell helped me to develop my skills in facilitating user-testing and analyzing test results. It was interesting to explore potential problem spaces for this user group and work beyond current design practices and trends like small and minimalistic elements for users who had no issues with vision, or mobility. I felt that overtime I had worked myself into a box when designing and stuck to what I was comfortable with, however, this project helped me recognize this issue and start researching different methods and styles of design to play with and encourged me to work outside of my comfort zone and experiment more.</p>
      <p class= "project-section-text">If I were to revisit this project I would want to flesh out the concept of this app more and possibly look into the health management side of it as I feel we were't able to touch on that topic enough when the target user group could benefit from a newer and more innovative way to manage their medications and doctors visits instead of focusing on taking useful apps such as reminders, calendars and journals (all of which are already availiable on the standard mobile phone).</p>
