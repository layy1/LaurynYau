      <div id= "about-title"><p>Hi I'm Lauryn!</p></div>
      <div id= "about-paragraph"><p>I am a designer and creative based in Vancouver. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree at Simon Fraser University studying Interactive Arts and Technology and I have an interest in UI/UX, branding and visual design. I strive to make unique and intuitive experiences that resonate with users and remain visually appealing. </p>
        <p> I constantly try to learn and seek new opportunities to exercise my skills in visual design, user-research and testing and grow my experiences as a designer to go above and beyond. My passion for visual arts and unique user interactions knows no bounds and I constantly search for inspiration and opportunities to utilize my creativity.</p>
        <p> In my spare time, I enjoy partaking in clubs on campus such as SFU MISA and Blueprint as a design coordinator and product designer. Outside of design I love baking and experimenting with new recipes, drawing, trying new matcha spots in the city and exploring new hobbies.</p></div>
