Their mission to enhance the collector car experience makes them an ideal partner for empowering restorers.</p>
  <p class="project-section-text">However, after primary (Google Forms and individual user testing) and secondary research our team found that there was <b>a disconnect between new classic car restorers in the form of knowledge gaps, part sourcing and scattered online resources on car restoration.</b></p>

  <p class="project-section-text">Based on some initial secondary research, we found that car maintenance and repairs cause problems for new or causual car owners. In searching deeper into more niche categories of cars, we found a need for an intervention in the growing classic car restoration space.</p>

        <p class= "highlight-title">Problem Space</p>
        <p class= "highlight-text">Despite rising interest among young enthusiasts in classic car restoration, beginners struggle to start and sustain projects due to skill gaps, scattered resources, and part sourcing challenges, reflecting an overall lack of structured support.</p>

    <section class= "project-section">
      <p class="project-section-head">User Research and Design Process</p>
      <p class="project-section-text">To better understand target audience and client needs and real-life user scenarios we conducted multiple rounds of user interviews and testing, a general Google Forms survey as well as secondary research on classic car restoration articles and blogs.</p>
      <p class="project-section-subhead">Key Survey Results</p>

      <ul class="project-section-text">
        <li>71.4% said <b>mentorship</b> would make them feel more ready to start a restoration project.</li>
        <li>85.7% expressed interest in learning through <b>online resources.</b></li>
        <li>71.4% said <b>step-by-step tutorials</b> as their ideal learning format.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="project-section-text"><b>Learning Points:</b> Jumping into a problem space involving users passionate about cars as someone who has no interest in cars was interesting from a learning perspective. The team and I conducted extensive research to fully understand and empathize with the pain points faced by users and their needs.</p>

        <p class="project-section-subhead">Iterative Designs</p>
        <p class="project-section-text">Our team went through multiple iterations of the app, taking in and applying new feedback every week from peers, users and our teaching team, as well as conducting structured usability testing with potential users.</p>
        <!-- <p class="project-section-subhead">First Iteration</p>

        <p class="project-section-text">Based on our research, the team needed to create an intervention to fulfill the missing resources users were seeking after purchasing a car from Hemmings. At this stage we heavily integrated Hemmings' original branding into our design sprints and focused on the overall user experience and consolodated features to supplement pain points found during our research.</p>

        <div class= "project-detail-img">
          <img src="img/hemmings_iteration1.png" class= "project-image" alt= "">
          <p class = "img-caption">Mockups of the app's first iteration.</p>
        </div> -->

        <p class="project-section-subhead">User-Testing Pain Points</p>
        <p class="project-section-text">Using Hemmings' current website and a rough prototype of our first iteration (which included our main features such as project building/tracking and tutorials) I conducted user-testing with given tasks and think-aloud testing to understand how our target audience (young/beginner car restorers) typically would use a tool such as Hemmings for their projects: </p>
        <ul class="project-section-text">
          <li><b>Cluttered Information:</b> Users noted while looking at Hemmings' website that the information is cluttered and they easily lose interest or get confused and would search elsewhere.</li>
          <li><b>Difficult to Navigate:</b> If a user needed a specific tutorial on the websiteit was difficult to navigate to Hemmings' listed tutorials as it was under multiple layers/tabs and took users longer to find.</li>
          <li><b>Consolodated Resources:</b> Users liked that the prototype had all the needed resources available in one place.</li>
          <li><b>Visual Tutorials:</b> When viewing tutorials in general, users found it more digestable to have broken up steps with related videos and notes for each step.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-section-subhead">Getting Creative</p>

        <p class="project-section-text">To add to the visual identity of our visual design I suggested taking inspiration from vintage diner tickets (separating text in rectangular boxes and retro colour palette) to lean into the era of cars Hemmings were helping to restore and paper/sticker textures and folder-like tabs to reference the process of car restorers, using paper and pencil to keep their projects organized, as we learned from our research.</p>
        <p class= "project-section-text">This iteration also introduced community pages, allowing users to browse car meets in their area. The addition of this feature was to further emphasize connecting the classic car community, specifically beginner restorers and expereinced restorers to bridge the growing knowledge gap.</p>

        <div class= "project-detail-img">
          <img src="img/hemmings_iteration2.png" class= "project-image" alt= "">
          <p class = "img-caption">Mockups of a version of our intervention.</p>
        </div>

        <p class= "project-section-text">In our next iteration we altered the colour palette to have a brighter background to adapt to the spaces where users would be using the app, such as under a car, to aid visibility of the screen. Further developing this design, I suggested we use collectible 'cards' to further incentivize user to continue their projects and share them. The use of cards references the era again, as card collecting/trading became popular in the 90s leaning into the time period of the classic cars owned by restorers and additionally could be seen on their app dashboard as an achievement.</p>
        <p class="project-section-text">This idea persisted throughout our future iterations ensure returning users and to make our platform unique and thoughtful. In our third iteration of the app we developed the community pages to include a forum for users to share their project cars and browse other projects for inspiration.</p>

        <div class= "project-detail-img">
          <img src="img/hemmings_iteration3.png" class= "project-image" alt= "">
          <p class = "img-caption">Mockups of the app's third iteration.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="project-section-subhead">Pivoting...</p>
        <p class="project-section-text">Leading up to the final week of the project, our team had to completely pivot from our developed visual design, as we received feedback that leaning too strongly into vintage aesthetics felt too decorative, disconnected from the Hemmings brand, and may seem cliché.</p>
        <p class="project-section-text"><b>Thus, we had to go back to the drawing board.</b></p>
        <p class="project-section-text">I spent more time looking into patterns, assets and aesthetics used on Hemmings' website to apply them  to our final design while still giving the final app a vintage feel to match with the aesthetic of classic cars. As a result the final UI was toned down and modernized to better suit the younger and tech-savvy target audience while still maintaining the vintage aesthetic and honouring Hemmings' current brand design.</p>

        </div>
          <p class = "project-section-text">Previously, Hemmings' website would assist in the pre-restoration phase (AKA finding and purchasing a classic car to restore) and would provide tutorials and parts for purchase on their website. However, if users needed additional or in-depth tutorials, resources to track their project process and connections to car events or other car restorers they would need to use other resources such as YouTube, spreadsheets, or online marketplaces.</p>

Users no longer will need to keep track of a multitude of sheets, tabs, etc. and can simply rely on the Hemmings app to track their projects, search for parts/potential projects and connect with fellow restorers.</p>

      <p class="project-section-head">Reflection</p>
      <p class="project-section-text">The problem space of this project proved to be a challenge for myself and my team because none of us had any prior knowledge or background in classic car restoration or cars in general, which was something our teaching team and judging panel praised us for as <b>we were still able to deliver a solution and tried to understand something we had no knowledge in.</b></p>
      <p class="project-section-text">Jumping into a completely new and unknown territory to try and provide a solution for issues users were experiencing and further enhance their experience proved to be daunting, but we were able to utilize user-testing and interviews and througly listen to real users to understand and empathize and get into their mindset while facing this problem space.</p>
      <p class="project-section-text">I hope to revisit this project in the future to continue fleshing out the features and <b>increase the quality of life for the users on the app</b>, looking into more user-testing and detail-oriented UX design.</p>
